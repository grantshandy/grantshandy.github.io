# Grant Handy
This is a little site that I use to host my [blog articles](#blog-posts), [project portfolio](./projects/), and [contact information](#contact).

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Utah. I like writing small projects in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), [Nix](https://nixos.org), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for fun.

## Blog Posts
