id=introduction><a aria-label="Anchor link for: introduction" class="no-underline text-md font-light hover:font-medium" href=#introduction></a>Introduction</h2><p>On first glance, making a first person game without an engine or a graphics API seems like an almost impossible task. In this post I'll show you how to do that using a simple variant of a method called ray casting.<p>My goal here is to show how something that looks complicated can be broken down into simple pieces, and if I've done my job right, it should feel like you've <em>discovered</em> how the game works.<p>First, we'll explore how the algorithm behind the game works, then we'll write it out line by line. Afterwards, we'll take a second look at the code to add some features and optimize it for size. I've tried to make this as accessible and friendly as possible but a healthy understanding of programming as well as Rust and basic geometry will help.<p>Here's a quick preview of what we'll be making:<figure class="mx-auto rounded-md flex w-3/4"><video class="rounded-md flex-grow" autoplay loop muted><source src=preview.webm type=video/webm></video></figure><p>If you just want to see the source code, you can check out the <a href=https://github.com/grantshandy/wasm4-raycaster>Github repository</a>.<p>My first experience with games like this (though I didn't know at the time), was in middle school with games like <a href=https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/360/36062.html>zDoom</a> on my calculator. zDoom (while not actually that fun), was fascinating to me because it could (kind of) create the illusion of depth and perspective, something I thought only "real" games could do.<p><img alt=zDoom src=https://grantshandy.github.io/raycasting/zdoom.png><p>zDoom was only an imitation of the original game Doom, in reality, it was much closer to Doom's predecessor, Wolfenstein 3D.<h3 id=wolfenstein-3d><a aria-label="Anchor link for: wolfenstein-3d" class="no-underline text-md font-light hover:font-medium" href=#wolfenstein-3d></a>Wolfenstein 3D</h3><p>Famously, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D>Wolfenstein 3D</a>, released in 1992, was one of the first 3D first-person games to run on consumer PCs. Back then, computers didn't have hardware 3D acceleration, let alone dedicated graphics cards, so how was this done?<p><img alt="A wolfenstein 3D screenshot" src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/Wolf3d_pc.png><p>Well, I should have said <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2.5D><em>pseudo</em>-3D</a> because no part of the game ran in three dimensions. The core of the game was an algorithm called ray casting<sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#1>1</a></sup>, a process of projecting a 2D game into a 3D perspective.<p>All the game entities were located at simple x and y positions on the map and could not move vertically. Upon release, I'm sure that this didn't matter, but with our current standards, it shows its age. The player could not look up or down, let alone crouch or jump.<p><img alt="A top-down view of the first level of Wolfenstein 3D" src=https://grantshandy.github.io/raycasting/wolfenstein-map.png><p>To add to that, all the levels were composed of single floors of buildings with no windows. Also, all walls were perfectly straight with corners placed at even intervals (something that will absolutely not come up later). These design features were all put here because of some of the essential restrictions of its simple ray-casting algorithm.<h2 id=the-algorithm><a aria-label="Anchor link for: the-algorithm" class="no-underline text-md font-light hover:font-medium" href=#the-algorithm></a>The Algorithm</h2><h3 id=the-basics><a aria-label="Anchor link for: the-basics" class="no-underline text-md font-light hover:font-medium" href=#the-basics></a>The Basics</h3><p>At the most fundamental level, ray casting depends on the simple fact that objects that are further away from us appear smaller while objects that are closer appear larger. Ray casting uses this fact to draw walls at shorter heights the further away they are from the player and at taller heights the closer they are.<p>Just this simple idea alone creates a convincing illusion of depth and allows us to move our player around just as if it were being rendered in actual 3D.<p>Ray casting <em>works</em> by tracing a path from the player to the closest wall for each column in the player's view. It then records the distances of each path before converting it into the height of a wall and drawing it on the screen as a vertical line.<p><img alt="figure overview" src=https://grantshandy.github.io/raycasting/figure-overview.svg><p>From what we know so far about the ray casting algorithm we can deduce that we will need to:<ul><li>Cast a ray from the player and stop at the nearest wall<li>Calculate the distance from the player to the nearest wall<li>Convert that distance into the height of a wall and draw it on the screen<li>Repeat that for each column on the screen ↺</ul><h3 id=digging-deeper><a aria-label="Anchor link for: digging-deeper" class="no-underline text-md font-light hover:font-medium" href=#digging-deeper></a>Digging Deeper</h3><p>The hardest part of this is "cast a ray from the player and stop at the nearest wall". This seems simple on paper but in practice, it can be <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_detection>pretty difficult</a>. If you had to come up with a ray casting implementation yourself, how would you approach it?<p><img alt="The Intersection Problem" src=https://grantshandy.github.io/raycasting/figure-question.svg><p>The first idea most people would probably have is to repeatedly extend the ray<sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#2>2</a></sup> a small amount and stop when it hits a wall. This is problematic because we might skip over the wall entirely when extending the ray. And if the ray does hit the wall correctly it will have very low accuracy because it won't know exactly where the wall started, just that it landed in one.<p><img alt="The Naive Solution" src=https://grantshandy.github.io/raycasting/figure-naive.svg><p>What we need is to find a way that we can <em>guarantee</em> that the ray will intersect with a wall and that it will stop right on the border of that wall. In math land, we might be able to do this by extending the ray an infinitely small distance infinitely many times. Sadly, we're not in math land so we can't do that.<p>The solution to this, as you might have guessed from the earlier foreshadowing, is to align all the walls to a grid. If we know that the walls fall at predictable intervals we can calculate a reliable distance to extend our ray each time.<p><img alt="Notice a pattern?" src=https://grantshandy.github.io/raycasting/figure-solution.svg><p>But how will the ray jump to the wall?<p>If you get out some grid paper and sketch out the lines between the player to various walls you'll start to notice some patterns. Ray "extensions" on their way to walls on horizontal grid lines all share a common width while ray "extensions" that land on walls at vertical grid lines all share a common height.<p>Once we extend the ray to the first grid line we can calculate these shared "extension widths" and "extension heights". Then we repeatedly extend it by these widths and heights to get the closest "vertical wall" and "horizontal wall" then use the smaller of the two distances.<p>I admit this is a bit confusing so I'll explain what this means in more depth:<h3 id=horizontal-intersections><a aria-label="Anchor link for: horizontal-intersections" class="no-underline text-md font-light hover:font-medium" href=#horizontal-intersections></a>Horizontal Intersections</h3><p>Here's an example diagram of what it looks like when a player looks at a "horizontal wall". This diagram is interactive, try dragging around the player!</p><script>function load_horizontal(){console.log('loading horizontal geogebra demo');new GGBApplet({appName:"geometry",id:'horizontal',showToolBar:false,showZoomButtons:false,showAlgebraInput:false,showLogging:false,enableRightClick:true,enableShiftDragZoom:false,preventFocus:true,showMenuBar:false,appletOnLoad:a=>{const b=document.getElementById('horizontal-outer').getBoundingClientRect();a.setWidth(b.right- b.left);a.setCoordSystem(-2.78,13.18,-4.48,7.48)},filename:'horizontal.ggb'}).inject('horizontal');document.getElementById("horizontal-load-btn").classList.add("hidden");document.getElementById("horizontal-outer").classList.remove("hidden")}</script><div class="flex flex-col items-center w-full border rounded-md overflow-hidden"><button class="btn btn-sm mt-5" id=horizontal-load-btn onclick=load_horizontal()>Load Demo</button><div class="w-full rounded-t-md overflow-hidden hidden" id=horizontal-outer><div class="rounded-t-md overflow-hidden w-full" id=horizontal></div></div><p>Notice how only the <em>width</em> between extensions changes when the player moves.</div><p>In horizontal wall intersections the height between "extensions" is always one, while the width between extensions can be derived from the angle of the ray. We always move up or down by exactly one and right or left by an amount determined by the angle of the ray.<p>You can see this by looking at the diagram, the width between $A_x$ and $B_x$ is the same as the width between $B_x$ and $C_x$, and the difference in height between all the points is just one.<p>Using some simple trigonometry we can find the width between horizontal grid intersections from the angle of the player. I'm going to save you the work and just give you the definition:<p>$$ \Delta H = \begin{cases} 1 &\text{if "facing up"} \\ -1 &\text{if "facing down"} \end{cases} $$ $$ \Delta W = \frac{\Delta H}{\tan(\theta)} $$<h3 id=vertical-intersections><a aria-label="Anchor link for: vertical-intersections" class="no-underline text-md font-light hover:font-medium" href=#vertical-intersections></a>Vertical Intersections</h3><p>Here's another interactive diagram of what it looks like when a ray intersects with a "vertical wall".</p><script>function load_vertical(){console.log('loading vertical geogebra demo');new GGBApplet({appName:"geometry",id:'vertical',showToolBar:false,showZoomButtons:false,showAlgebraInput:false,showLogging:false,enableRightClick:true,enableShiftDragZoom:false,preventFocus:true,showMenuBar:false,appletOnLoad:a=>{const b=document.getElementById('vertical-outer').getBoundingClientRect();a.setWidth(b.right- b.left);a.setCoordSystem(-3.097,8.238,2.274,10.769)},filename:'vertical.ggb'}).inject('vertical');document.getElementById("vertical-load-btn").classList.add("hidden");document.getElementById("vertical-outer").classList.remove("hidden")}</script><div class="flex flex-col items-center w-full border rounded-md overflow-hidden"><button class="btn btn-sm mt-5" id=vertical-load-btn onclick=load_vertical()>Load Demo</button><div class="w-full rounded-t-md overflow-hidden hidden" id=vertical-outer><div class="rounded-t-md overflow-hidden w-full" id=vertical></div></div><p>Here the <em>height</em> between extensions changes while the width stays the same.</div><p>Vertical grid intersections are the same as horizontal grid intersections, just rotated 90°. In vertical grid intersections the <em>width</em> between our "ray extensions" is constant while the <em>height</em> is created from the angle of the ray. Like last time, I'm going to skip ahead and define our variables for you.<p>$$ \Delta W = \begin{cases} 1 &\text{if "facing right"} \\ -1 &\text{if "facing left"} \end{cases} $$ $$ \Delta H = \Delta W * \tan(\theta) $$<h3 id=summary><a aria-label="Anchor link for: summary" class="no-underline text-md font-light hover:font-medium" href=#summary></a>Summary</h3><p>Now that we know pretty much exactly how we'll do this we can compile it into a more detailed step-by-step list for our program to execute on each frame.<p>For each column on the screen:<ol><li>Find the angle for the ray from the player's angle and field of view.<li>Determine the distance to the nearest wall that the ray intersects with: <ul><li>Get the first "horizontal" wall the ray intersects with.<li>Get the first "vertical" wall the ray intersects with.<li>Calculate the distance to the wall from the closest of those two.</ul><li>Convert that distance into the height of a wall on the screen and then draw it.</ol><h2 id=implementation><a aria-label="Anchor link for: implementation" class="no-underline text-md font-light hover:font-medium" href=#implementation></a>Implementation</h2><p>Now that we understand how the underlying algorithm works we can write a program that implements it using WASM-4.<p>Wait why WASM-4? The official answer is that we need a way for our program to accept user input and draw to the screen. The real answer is because I like it a lot.<p><a href=https://wasm4.org>WASM-4</a> is a tiny game engine that runs WebAssembly (<code>.wasm</code>) files. Most compiled programming languages (C, C++, Rust, Zig, etc.) can compile to WebAssembly which means games for WASM-4 can be written in any of those languages! WASM-4 is <em>extremely</em> minimal, the "4" in "WASM-4" is there because you can only draw four colors on screen at once.<p>I'll be using Rust, but you could follow along with any language that can compile to WebAssembly. If you're more familiar with JavaScript I recommend <a href=https://assemblyscript.org>AssemblyScript</a>.<p><img alt src=https://grantshandy.github.io/raycasting/wasm4-demo.svg><p>WASM-4 will let us create <em>tiny</em> games because it provides a simple platform to build off. WASM-4 handles windowing, graphics rendering, and gamepad input, we have to do everything else.<p>Here are the specs for the WASM-4 "fantasy console" from the website:<blockquote><ul><li>Display: 160x160 pixels, 4 customizable colors, updated at 60 Hz.<li>Memory: 64 KB linear RAM, memory-mapped I/O, save states.<li>Cartridge Size Limit: 64 KB.<li>Input: Keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, up to 4 gamepads.<li>Audio: 2 pulse wave channels, 1 triangle wave channel, 1 noise channel.<li>Disk Storage: 1024 bytes.</ul></blockquote><p>If you know a bit about computer hardware you'll know this is an incredibly restrictive environment for a game to run in. That's the fun of it though, seeing how much you can cram into 160x160px, 4 colors, and 64KB of disk space. If you want to see what people are able to create with it, check out the <a href=https://wasm4.org/play>WASM-4 site</a> for some very impressive games (including a <a href=https://wasm4.org/play/taufl>flight simulator</a>!).<p>I'll probably make a more in-depth post on WASM-4 in the future, but for now, this explanation should be good enough for our case. All you need to run WASM-4 games is to <a href=https://wasm4.org/docs/getting-started/setup>download and install the minimal runtime</a>.<h3 id=project-setup><a aria-label="Anchor link for: project-setup" class="no-underline text-md font-light hover:font-medium" href=#project-setup></a>Project Setup</h3><p>First, make sure the Rust toolchain for <code>wasm32-unknown-unknown</code> is installed:<pre class=language-bash data-lang=bash><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash> $ rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown   
</code></pre><p>Because WASM-4 runs WebAssembly files we have to configure our project to create one.<pre class=language-bash data-lang=bash><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash> $ cargo new raycaster && cd raycaster
</code></pre><p>Add this to to <code>Cargo.toml</code>:<pre class=language-toml data-lang=toml><code class=language-toml data-lang=toml>[profile.release]
opt-level = "z"         # optimize end .wasm file for size
lto = true              # enable link time optimizations
codegen-units = 1       # compile crates one after another so the compiler can optimize better
strip = true            # strip expensive panic clean-up logic
panic = "abort"         # remove debug symbols

[dependencies]
libm = "0.2"            # import libm for no_std math functions
</code></pre><p>In the crate configuration file <code>.cargo/config.toml</code>, add:<pre class=language-toml data-lang=toml><code class=language-toml data-lang=toml>[build]
target = "wasm32-unknown-unknown"

[target.wasm32-unknown-unknown]
runner = "w4 run-native"
rustflags = [
    "-C", "link-arg=--import-memory",
    "-C", "link-arg=--initial-memory=65536",
    "-C", "link-arg=--max-memory=65536",
    "-C", "link-arg=-zstack-size=14752",
]
</code></pre><p>This will tell cargo to use WebAssembly as the default target and to pass some flags to rustc that tells our program to reserve some memory for WASM-4.<p>Now, let's add some simple WASM-4 boilerplate to the main source file <code>src/main.rs</code>:<pre class=language-rust data-lang=rust><code class=language-rust data-lang=rust>#![no_main]
#![no_std]

use core::{arch::wasm32, panic::PanicInfo};

const GAMEPAD1: *const u8 = 0x16 as *const u8;

const BUTTON_LEFT: u8 = 16;  // 00010000
const BUTTON_RIGHT: u8 = 32; // 00100000
const BUTTON_UP: u8 = 64;    // 01000000
const BUTTON_DOWN: u8 = 128; // 10000000

extern "C" {
    fn vline(x: i32, y: i32, len: u32);
}

#[panic_handler]
fn phandler(_: &PanicInfo<'_>) -> ! {
    wasm32::unreachable();
}

#[no_mangle]
unsafe fn update() {
    if *GAMEPAD1 & BUTTON_UP != 0 {
        vline(80, 20, 120);
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Here's a little explanation of the code here for those who aren't familiar with Rust or WASM-4:<ul><li><p><code>#![no_std]</code> prohibits the program from accessing the Rust standard library. This is essential in almost all WASM-4 games because the standard library is large and might put our game over the 64KB size limit.</p><li><p><a href=https://wasm4.org/docs/reference/memory#gamepads><code>GAMEPAD1</code></a> is a pointer to the current state of the first gamepad (the arrow keys in our case). The runtime will update this section of memory with the state of our gamepad (keyboard) on each frame.</p><li><p>The constants <code>BUTTON_LEFT</code> through <code>BUTTON_DOWN</code> describe the bits in the gamepad which describe each button.

One way we could store the map as <code>[[bool; WIDTH]; HEIGHT]</code> and access it through <code>map[][]</code>. Storing the map this way wouldn't be very elegant because we'd have to type out each cell individually as a <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.<p>Because the boolean value (wall or no wall) can be represented by a single bit we can use the bits inside of a number to represent the map: <code>[&LTint>; HEIGHT]</code>. In this case, <code>[u16; HEIGHT]</code> can represent a map with a width of 16 cells and an arbitrary height of our choosing. Using Rust's integer literal syntax we can represent our map pretty simply by writing a <code>1</code> where there is a wall and a <code>0</code> where there is no wall:<pre class=language-rust data-lang=rust><code class=language-rust data-lang=rust>const MAP: [u16; 8] = [
    0b1111111111111111,
    0b1000001010000101,
    0b1011100000110101,
    0b1000111010010001,
    0b1010001011110111,
    0b1011101001100001,
    0b1000100000001101,
    0b1111111111111111,
];
</code></pre><p>The more difficult thing about this way of storing the map is accessing it. To do this we have to write a function that first indexes into the row then into the specific column by masking and then shifting the row. This post is already long as it is so for the sake of time I'm not going to go in-depth about how the X coordinate lookup bit operations works in this function.<pre class=language-rust data-lang=rust><code class=language-rust data-lang=rust>/// Check if the map contains a wall at a point.
fn point_in_wall(x: f32, y: f32) -> bool {
    match MAP.get(y as usize) {
        Some(line) => (line & (0b1 << x as usize)) != 0,
        None => true,
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Because our map is surrounded by walls it's safe to tell the caller of this function that there is a wall if it calls for a coordinate that is out of bounds.<h3 id=maintaining-game-state><a aria-label="Anchor link for: maintaining-game-state" class="no-underline text-md font-light hover:font-medium" href=#maintaining-game-state></a>Maintaining Game State</h3><p>The map stays constant throughout the runtime of the program, but the player's position and angle change. Because WASM-4 calls <code>update</code> on each frame the only way to store our game state across frames is via something like Rust's <a href=https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/static-items.html><code>static mut</code></a>. Because <code>static mut</code> is <a href=https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html><code>unsafe</code></a> we should consolidate our game logic and state in a single <code>struct</code> so we minimize the number of times we modify our state through <code>static mut</code>.<p>Only three variables are required to describe the player's view: the X and Y position and viewing angle.<pre class=language-rust data-lang=rust><code class=language-rust data-lang=rust>struct State {
    player_x: f32,
    player_y: f32,
    player_angle: f32,
}    
</code></pre><p>Now let's initialize a <code>State</code> in a global <code>static mut</code>:<pre class=language-rust data-lang=rust><code class=language-rust data-lang=rust>static mut STATE: State = State {
    player_x: 1.5,
    player_y: 1.5,
    player_angle: 0.0,
};
</code></pre><blockquote><p><em><code>player_x</code> and <code>player_y</code> are both initially set at 1.5 so the player starts in the center of a cell and not inside a wall.</em></blockquote><p>Not only is accessing <code>State</code> <code>unsafe</code> behavior, most interactions with are WASM-4 are. (dereferencing raw pointers, calling external functions, etc.)<p>For those not familiar with Rust, <code>unsafe</code> is a keyword/block that you give the compiler when you need to get around its memory safety guarantees. Using <code>unsafe</code> tells the Rust compiler "I know what I'm doing, don't bother me about it". The problem is that often we don't know what we're doing. Because of this, best practice is to keep <code>unsafe</code> usage to a minimum.<p>If we consolidate <code>unsafe</code> behavior into <code>fn update</code> and game logic into <code>State</code> we isolate our state and give some structure to our program. This gives us a pretty clear line: <code>unsafe</code> I/O with WASM-4 in <code>fn update</code>, safe game logic in <code>State</code>.<p><img alt src=https://grantshandy.github.io/raycasting/unsafe-flow.svg><h3 id=moving-the-character><a aria-label="Anchor link for: moving-the-character" class="no-underline text-md font-light hover:font-medium" href=#moving-the-character></a>Moving the Character</h3><p>One of the easier parts of this game is moving the character. Because accessing our <code>STATE</code> from outside is <code>unsafe</code>, let's create a method inside of <code>State</code> to move the character and pass in the inputs on each frame.<pre class=language-rust data-lang=rust><code class=language-rust data-lang=rust>impl State {
    /// move the character

        let previous_position = (self.player_x, self.player_y);

        if up {
            self.player_x += cosf(self.player_angle) * STEP_SIZE;
            self.player_y += -sinf(self.player_angle) * STEP_SIZE;
        }

        if down {
            self.player_x -= cosf(self.player_angle) * STEP_SIZE;

</code></pre><p>If you've ever moved a player in a game and know some basic trigonometry this should all look familiar. Note that calls to <code>sinf</code> are negative because our Y-axis is flipped.<p>If the player is asking us to move the player forwards or backward we modify the player's x and y positions based on the <code>cosf</code> and <code>sinf</code> values of the player's angle multiplied by a constant <code>STEP_SIZE</code>.<p>Just for you, I'll give you a magic number that works pretty well.

Well, <code>vline</code> is <code>unsafe</code> so we should keep it in <code>fn update</code>.<p>Let's do this by defining <code>State::get_view</code> which returns a list of all the wall heights.

Knowing this, it's fairly easy to assign different colors to walls.<p>WASM-4 has a very unique way of setting which color its functions use to draw. Every time a draw function is called in WASM-4 it decides what color to use based on an index kept a bit of memory called <code>DRAW_COLORS</code>. WASM-4 makes changing <code>DRAW_COLORS</code> easy, we can set it by using simple hex notation.<p>Let's add <code>DRAW_COLORS</code> next to <code>GAMEPAD1</code> at the top of our file:<pre class=language-rust data-lang=rust><code class=language-rust data-lang=rust>const DRAW_COLORS: *mut u16 = 0x14 as *mut u16;

</code></pre><p>Now, in <code>State::get_view</code>, we can rewrite it to pass along if the wall should be drawn "with a shadow" or not:<pre class=language-rust data-lang=rust><code class=language-rust data-lang=rust>impl State {
    /// Returns 160 wall heights and their "color" from the player's perspective.
    pub fn get_view(&self) -> [(i32, bool); 160] {
        // The player's FOV is split in half by their viewing angle.
        // In order to get the ray's starting angle we must
        // add half the FOV to the player's angle to get
        // the edge of the player's FOV.
        let starting_angle = self.player_angle + HALF_FOV;

        let mut walls = [(0, false); 160];

        for (idx, wall) in walls.iter_mut().enumerate() {
            // `idx` is what number ray we are, `wall` is
            // a mutable reference to a value in `walls`.
            let angle = starting_angle - idx as f32 * ANGLE_STEP;

            // Get both the closest horizontal and vertical wall
            // intersections for this angle.
            let h_dist = self.horizontal_intersection(angle);
            let v_dist = self.vertical_intersection(angle);

            let (min_dist, shadow) = if h_dist < v_dist {
                (h_dist, false)
            } else {
                (v_dist, true)
            };

            // Get the minimum of the two distances and
            // "convert" it into a wall height.
            *wall = (
                (WALL_HEIGHT / (min_dist * cosf(angle - self.player_angle))) as i32,
                shadow,
            );
        }

        walls
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Now let's make these changes in <code>fn update</code>:<pre class=language-rust data-lang=rust><code class=language-rust data-lang=rust>#[no_mangle]
unsafe fn update() {
    STATE.update(
        *GAMEPAD1 & BUTTON_UP != 0,
        *GAMEPAD1 & BUTTON_DOWN != 0,
        *GAMEPAD1 & BUTTON_LEFT != 0,
        *GAMEPAD1 & BUTTON_RIGHT != 0,
    );

    // Go through each column on screen and draw walls in the center.
    for (x, wall) in STATE.get_view().iter().enumerate() {
        let (height, shadow) = wall;

        if *shadow {
            // draw with color 2 for walls with "shadow"
            *DRAW_COLORS = 0x2;
        } else {
            // draw with color 3 for walls without "shadow"
            *DRAW_COLORS = 0x3;
        }

        vline(x as i32, 80 - (height / 2), *height as u32);
    }
}

12K  target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/raycaster.wasm
</code></pre><p>This is nowhere near the 2K executable I promised in the title, so how are we going to get there? One way you can reduce the size of <code>.wasm</code> files is by using <code>wasm-opt</code>. You can usually get <code>wasm-opt</code> by installing the <a href=https://pkgs.org/download/binaryen><code>binaryen</code></a> package. <code>wasm-opt</code> was specifically designed to optimize <code>.wasm</code> files for size by removing dead code and duplicate instructions that the compiler left behind.<p>Let's try using <code>wasm-opt</code> to reduce the size of the <code>.wasm</code>:<pre class=language-bash data-lang=bash><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash> $ wasm-opt -Oz target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/raycaster.wasm \

The final step requires we remove <code>libm</code> completely and replace it with our own implementation.<p>Let's start by deleting the old <code>libm</code> import statement and removing it from <code>Cargo.toml</code>. After that we can add an approximation of the <code>sinf</code> function using <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhaskara_I%27s_sine_approximation_formula>Bhaskara I's sin approximation</a> and redefine <code>cosf</code> and <code>tanf</code> in terms of it.<p>$$ \sin(x) \approx \frac{16x(\pi-x)}{5\pi^2-4x(\pi-x)} \text{ when } (0 \le x \le \pi) $$<p>This approximation is very good, especially for the time it was discovered :). And because we're operating with wall heights only between integers 0 and 160, any differences between <code>libm::sinf</code> and our <code>sinf</code> will be indistinguishable.<p>First, make sure to also import $\tau$ from the core library and define a constant for $5\pi^2$ which Bhaskara I's approximation uses:<pre class=language-rust data-lang=rust><code class=language-rust data-lang=rust>use core::f32::consts::{FRAC_PI_2, PI, TAU};

const FIVE_PI_SQUARED: f32 = 5.0 * (PI * PI);
</code></pre><p>Then, let's add our new <code>sinf</code><sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#3>3</a></sup>:<pre class=language-rust data-lang=rust><code class=language-rust data-lang=rust>fn sinf(mut x: f32) -> f32 {
    let y = x / TAU;
    let z = y - floorf(y);
    x = z * TAU;

    let sinf_imp = |x: f32| -> f32 {
        // these magic numbers were discovered 1400 years ago!
        (16.0 * x * (PI - x)) / (FIVE_PI_SQUARED - (4.0 * x * (PI - x)))
    };

    if x > PI {
        -sinf_imp(x - PI)
    } else {
        sinf_imp(x)
    }
}
</code></pre><blockquote><p>Thanks to <a href=https://github.com/Cyborus04>Cyborus04</a> for helping me with this <code>sinf</code> function.</blockquote><p>Now we can create <code>cosf</code> and <code>tanf</code> functions from their definitions relating to <code>sinf</code>:<p>$\cos(x) = \sin(x + \frac{\pi}{2})$<pre class=language-rust data-lang=rust><code class=language-rust data-lang=rust>fn cosf(x: f32) -> f32 {
    sinf(x + FRAC_PI_2)
}
</code></pre><p>$\tan(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}$<pre class=language-rust data-lang=rust><code class=language-rust data-lang=rust>fn tanf(x: f32) -> f32 {
    sinf(x) / cosf(x)
}
</code></pre><p>Alright, now that we've replaced the <code>libm</code> trig functions, what about <code>sqrtf</code>, <code>ceilf</code>, <code>floorf</code>, and <code>fabsf</code>? This is where <em>nightly</em> Rust is required, so make sure you've switched you've installed <code>wasm32-unknown-unknown</code> for nightly and build on nightly each time with <code>+nightly</code>:<pre class=language-bash data-lang=bash><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash> $ rustup +nightly install wasm32-unknown-unknown
</code></pre><pre class=language-bash data-lang=bash><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash> $ cargo +nightly build --release
</code></pre><p>Nightly Rust enables us to use an experimental module in the core library named <code>core::intrinsics</code>. <code>core::intrinsics</code> provides us some functions that the compiler knows how to optimize so we don't have to write them ourself. In order to turn on the experimental intrinsics feature, add <code>#![feature(core_intrinsics)]</code> to the top of your file:<pre class=language-rust data-lang=rust><code class=language-rust data-lang=rust>#![no_main]
#![no_std]
#![feature(core_intrinsics)]
</code></pre><p>Now we can create some "safe" wrappers over the unsafe functions that <code>core::intrinsics</code> provides for us:<pre class=language-rust data-lang=rust><code class=language-rust data-lang=rust>// >:)

fn sqrtf(x: f32) -> f32 {
    unsafe { core::intrinsics::sqrtf32(x) }
}

fn floorf(x: f32) -> f32 {
    unsafe { core::intrinsics::floorf32(x) }
}

fn ceilf(x: f32) -> f32 {
    unsafe { core::intrinsics::ceilf32(x) }
}

fn fabsf(x: f32) -> f32 {
    unsafe { core::intrinsics::fabsf32(x) }
}
</code></pre><p>Lets compile to and see if it works... and<pre class=language-bash data-lang=bash><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash># after `cargo +nightly b -r` and `wasm-opt`

You can get this to fit in even smaller sizes and I encourage you to try! There are some sections in this code that I've even intentionally made more readable at the cost of taking up slightly more instructions than they need to just so you can optimize it :)<p>I wrote this post because when I was first writing my raycasted game I couldn't find any resources that explained how the algorithm worked in sane code and plain language.<p>I hope this was interesting and useful for you! Ray casting (like in this simple way) in FPS games was always a mystery to me before I looked into them, I hope you'll agree that the algorithm behind it is surprisingly elegant.<footer class="w-full flow-root"><i class=float-left> <a href=https://buymeacoffee.com/granthandy>buy me a coffee?</a> </i><i class=float-right> <a href=/>return to main page</a> </i></footer></article></div>
