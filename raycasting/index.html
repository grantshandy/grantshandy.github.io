<h1>A First-Person Game in 2KB</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>On first glance, making a first person game without an engine or a graphics API seems like an almost impossible task.
In this post I'll show you how to do that using a simple variant of a method called ray casting.</p>
<p>My goal here is to show how something that looks complicated can be broken down into simple pieces,
and if I've done my job right, it should feel like you've <em>discovered</em> how the game works.</p>
<p>First, we'll explore how the algorithm behind the game works, then we'll write it out line by line.
Afterwards, we'll take a second look at the code to add some features and optimize it for size.
I've tried to make this as accessible and friendly as possible but a healthy understanding of programming as well as Rust and basic geometry will help.</p>
<p>Here's a quick preview of what we'll be making:</p>
<p><img src="https://grantshandy.github.io/raycasting/preview.gif" alt="preview" /></p>
<p>If you just want to see the source code, you can check out the <a href="https://github.com/grantshandy/wasm4-raycaster">Github repository</a>.</p>
<p>My first experience with games like this (though I didn't know at the time), was in middle school with games like <a href="https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/360/36062.html">zDoom</a> on my calculator.
zDoom (while not actually that fun), was fascinating to me because it could (kind of) create the illusion of depth and perspective, something I thought only "real" games could do.</p>
<p><img src="https://grantshandy.github.io/raycasting/zdoom.png" alt="zDoom" /></p>
<p>zDoom was only an imitation of the original game Doom, in reality, it was much closer to Doom's predecessor, Wolfenstein 3D.</p>
<h3 id="wolfenstein-3d">Wolfenstein 3D</h3>
<p>Famously, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D">Wolfenstein 3D</a>, released in 1992, was one of the first 3D first-person games to run on consumer PCs.
Back then, computers didn't have hardware 3D acceleration, let alone dedicated graphics cards, so how was this done?</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/Wolf3d_pc.png" alt="A wolfenstein 3D screenshot" /></p>
<p>Well, I should have said <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2.5D"><em>pseudo</em>-3D</a> because no part of the game ran in three dimensions.
The core of the game was an algorithm called ray casting[^1], a process of projecting a 2D game into a 3D perspective.</p>
<p>All the game entities were located at simple x and y positions on the map and could not move vertically.
Upon release, I'm sure that this didn't matter, but with our current standards, it shows its age.
The player could not look up or down, let alone crouch or jump.</p>
<p><img src="https://grantshandy.github.io/raycasting/wolfenstein-map.png" alt="A top-down view of the first level of Wolfenstein 3D" /></p>
<p>To add to that, all the levels were composed of single floors of buildings with no windows.
Also, all walls were perfectly straight with corners placed at even intervals (something that will absolutely not come up later).
These design features were all put here because of some of the essential restrictions of its simple ray-casting algorithm.</p>
<h2 id="the-algorithm">The Algorithm</h2>
<h3 id="the-basics">The Basics</h3>
<p>At the most fundamental level, ray casting depends on the simple fact that objects that are further away from us appear smaller while objects that are closer appear larger.
Ray casting uses this fact to draw walls at shorter heights the further away they are from the player and at taller heights the closer they are.</p>
<p>Just this simple idea alone creates a convincing illusion of depth and allows us to move our player around just as if it were being rendered in actual 3D.</p>
<p>Ray casting <em>works</em> by tracing a path from the player to the closest wall for each column in the player's view.
It then records the distances of each path before converting it into the height of a wall and drawing it on the screen as a vertical line.</p>
<p><img src="https://grantshandy.github.io/raycasting/figure-overview.svg" alt="figure overview" /></p>
<p>From what we know so far about the ray casting algorithm we can deduce that we will need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cast a ray from the player and stop at the nearest wall</li>
<li>Calculate the distance from the player to the nearest wall</li>
<li>Convert that distance into the height of a wall and draw it on the screen</li>
<li>Repeat that for each column on the screen ↺</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="digging-deeper">Digging Deeper</h3>
<p>The hardest part of this is "cast a ray from the player and stop at the nearest wall".
This seems simple on paper but in practice, it can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_detection">pretty difficult</a>.
If you had to come up with a ray casting implementation yourself, how would you approach it?</p>
<p><img src="https://grantshandy.github.io/raycasting/figure-question.svg" alt="The Intersection Problem" /></p>
<p>The first idea most people would probably have is to repeatedly extend the ray[^2] a small amount and stop when it hits a wall.
This is problematic because we might skip over the wall entirely when extending the ray.
And if the ray does hit the wall correctly it will have very low accuracy because it won't know exactly where the wall started, just that it landed in one.</p>
<p><img src="https://grantshandy.github.io/raycasting/figure-naive.svg" alt="The Naive Solution" /></p>
<p>What we need is to find a way that we can <em>guarantee</em> that the ray will intersect with a wall and that it will stop right on the border of that wall.
In math land, we might be able to do this by extending the ray an infinitely small distance infinitely many times.
Sadly, we're not in math land so we can't do that.</p>
<p>The solution to this, as you might have guessed from the earlier foreshadowing, is to align all the walls to a grid.
If we know that the walls fall at predictable intervals we can calculate a reliable distance to extend our ray each time.</p>
<p><img src="https://grantshandy.github.io/raycasting/figure-solution.svg" alt="Notice a pattern?" /></p>
<p>But how will the ray jump to the wall?</p>
<p>If you get out some grid paper and sketch out the lines between the player to various walls you'll start to notice some patterns.
Ray "extensions" on their way to walls on horizontal grid lines all share a common width while ray "extensions" that land on walls at vertical grid lines all share a common height.</p>
<p>Once we extend the ray to the first grid line we can calculate these shared "extension widths" and "extension heights".
Then we repeatedly extend it by these widths and heights to get the closest "vertical wall" and  "horizontal wall" then use the smaller of the two distances.</p>
<p>I admit this is a bit confusing so I'll explain what this means in more depth:</p>
<h3 id="horizontal-intersections">Horizontal Intersections</h3>
<p>Here's an example diagram of what it looks like when a player looks at a "horizontal wall".
This diagram is interactive, try dragging around the player!</p>
<script>
  function load_horizontal() {
    console.log('loading horizontal geogebra demo');

    new GGBApplet({
        appName: "geometry",
        id: 'horizontal',
        showToolBar: false,
        showZoomButtons: false,
        showAlgebraInput: false,
        showLogging: false,
        enableRightClick: true,
        enableShiftDragZoom: false,
        preventFocus: true,
        showMenuBar: false,
        appletOnLoad: (api) => {
          const rect = document.getElementById('horizontal-outer').getBoundingClientRect();

          api.setWidth(rect.right - rect.left);
          api.setCoordSystem(-2.78, 13.18, -4.48, 7.48);
        },
        filename: 'horizontal.ggb'
      })
      .inject('horizontal');

    document.getElementById("horizontal-load-btn").classList.add("hidden");
    document.getElementById("horizontal-outer").classList.remove("hidden");
  }
</script>

<div>
  <button onclick="load_horizontal()" id="horizontal-load-btn">Load Demo</button>
  <div id='horizontal-outer'>
    <div id='horizontal'></div>
  </div>
  <p>Notice how only the <em>width</em> between extensions changes when the player moves.</p>

</div>
<p>In horizontal wall intersections the height between "extensions" is always one, while the width between extensions can be derived from the angle of the ray.
We always move up or down by exactly one and right or left by an amount determined by the angle of the ray.</p>
<p>You can see this by looking at the diagram, the width between $A_x$ and $B_x$ is the same as the width between $B_x$ and $C_x$, and the difference in height between all the points is just one.</p>
<p>Using some simple trigonometry we can find the width between horizontal grid intersections from the angle of the player.
I'm going to save you the work and just give you the definition:</p>
<p>$$ \Delta H = \begin{cases} 1 &amp;\text{if "facing up"} \\ -1 &amp;\text{if "facing down"} \end{cases} $$
$$ \Delta W = \frac{\Delta H}{\tan(\theta)} $$</p>
<h3 id="vertical-intersections">Vertical Intersections</h3>
<p>Here's another interactive diagram of what it looks like when a ray intersects with a "vertical wall".</p>
<script>
  function load_vertical() {
    console.log('loading vertical geogebra demo');

    new GGBApplet({
        appName: "geometry",
        id: 'vertical',
        showToolBar: false,
        showZoomButtons: false,
        showAlgebraInput: false,
        showLogging: false,
        enableRightClick: true,
        enableShiftDragZoom: false,
        preventFocus: true,
        showMenuBar: false,
        appletOnLoad: (api) => {
          const rect = document.getElementById('vertical-outer').getBoundingClientRect();

          api.setWidth(rect.right - rect.left);
          api.setCoordSystem(-3.097, 8.238, 2.274, 10.769);
        },
        filename: 'vertical.ggb'
      })
      .inject('vertical');

    document.getElementById("vertical-load-btn").classList.add("hidden");
    document.getElementById("vertical-outer").classList.remove("hidden");
  }
</script>

<div>
  <button onclick="load_vertical()" id="vertical-load-btn">Load Demo</button>
  <div id='vertical-outer'>
    <div id='vertical'></div>
  </div>
  <p>Here the <em>height</em> between extensions changes while the width stays the same.</p>

</div>
<p>Vertical grid intersections are the same as horizontal grid intersections, just rotated 90°.
In vertical grid intersections the <em>width</em> between our "ray extensions" is constant while the <em>height</em> is created from the angle of the ray.
Like last time, I'm going to skip ahead and define our variables for you.</p>
<p>$$ \Delta W = \begin{cases} 1 &amp;\text{if "facing right"} \\ -1 &amp;\text{if "facing left"} \end{cases} $$
$$ \Delta H = \Delta W * \tan(\theta) $$</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Now that we know pretty much exactly how we'll do this we can compile it into a more detailed step-by-step list for our program to execute on each frame.</p>
<p>For each column on the screen:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the angle for the ray from the player's angle and field of view.</li>
<li>Determine the distance to the nearest wall that the ray intersects with:
<ul>
<li>Get the first "horizontal" wall the ray intersects with.</li>
<li>Get the first "vertical" wall the ray intersects with.</li>
<li>Calculate the distance to the wall from the closest of those two.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Convert that distance into the height of a wall on the screen and then draw it.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>Now that we understand how the underlying algorithm works we can write a program that implements it using WASM-4.</p>
<p>Wait why WASM-4?
The official answer is that we need a way for our program to accept user input and draw to the screen.
The real answer is because I like it a lot.</p>
<p><a href="https://wasm4.org">WASM-4</a> is a tiny game engine that runs WebAssembly (<code>.wasm</code>) files.
Most compiled programming languages (C, C++, Rust, Zig, etc.) can compile to WebAssembly which means games for WASM-4 can be written in any of those languages!
WASM-4 is <em>extremely</em> minimal, the "4" in "WASM-4" is there because you can only draw four colors on screen at once.</p>
<p>I'll be using Rust, but you could follow along with any language that can compile to WebAssembly.
If you're more familiar with JavaScript I recommend <a href="https://assemblyscript.org">AssemblyScript</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://grantshandy.github.io/raycasting/wasm4-demo.svg" alt="" /></p>
<p>WASM-4 will let us create <em>tiny</em> games because it provides a simple platform to build off.
WASM-4 handles windowing, graphics rendering, and gamepad input, we have to do everything else.</p>
<p>Here are the specs for the WASM-4 "fantasy console" from the website:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Display: 160x160 pixels, 4 customizable colors, updated at 60 Hz.</li>
<li>Memory: 64 KB linear RAM, memory-mapped I/O, save states.</li>
<li>Cartridge Size Limit: 64 KB.</li>
<li>Input: Keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, up to 4 gamepads.</li>
<li>Audio: 2 pulse wave channels, 1 triangle wave channel, 1 noise channel.</li>
<li>Disk Storage: 1024 bytes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you know a bit about computer hardware you'll know this is an incredibly restrictive environment for a game to run in.
That's the fun of it though, seeing how much you can cram into 160x160px, 4 colors, and 64KB of disk space.
If you want to see what people are able to create with it, check out the <a href="https://wasm4.org/play">WASM-4 site</a> for some very impressive games (including a <a href="https://wasm4.org/play/taufl">flight simulator</a>!).</p>
<p>I'll probably make a more in-depth post on WASM-4 in the future, but for now, this explanation should be good enough for our case.
All you need to run WASM-4 games is to <a href="https://wasm4.org/docs/getting-started/setup">download and install the minimal runtime</a>.</p>
<h3 id="project-setup">Project Setup</h3>
<p>First, make sure the Rust toolchain for <code>wasm32-unknown-unknown</code> is installed:</p>

</span></code></pre>
<p>Because WASM-4 runs WebAssembly files we have to configure our project to create one.</p>

<p>This will tell cargo to use WebAssembly as the default target and to pass some flags to rustc that tells our program to reserve some memory for WASM-4.</p>

</span></code></pre>
<p>Here's a little explanation of the code here for those who aren't familiar with Rust or WASM-4:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>#![no_std]</code> prohibits the program from accessing the Rust standard library.
This is essential in almost all WASM-4 games because the standard library is large and might put our game over the 64KB size limit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://wasm4.org/docs/reference/memory#gamepads"><code>GAMEPAD1</code></a> is a pointer to the current state of the first gamepad (the arrow keys in our case).
The runtime will update this section of memory with the state of our gamepad (keyboard) on each frame.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The constants <code>BUTTON_LEFT</code> through <code>BUTTON_DOWN</code> describe the bits in the gamepad which describe each button.
We can use these to check if <code>GAMEPAD1</code> says that a button is down, that's what we're doing when we call <code>*GAMEPAD1 &amp; BUTTON_UP != 0</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>extern "C" fn vline</code> links our game to an external function WASM-4 provides for us, <a href="https://wasm4.org/docs/reference/functions/#vlinex-y-len"><code>vline</code></a>.
<code>vline</code> draws a vertical line on the window at <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> and extends it down <code>len</code> pixels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>#[panic_handler] fn phandler</code> is a little bit of boilerplate that Rust requires we provide if we choose to use <code>#![no_std]</code>. This function will run when the program panics. Because WASM-4 is such a restrictive environment the only thing we can really do is call <code>wasm32::unreachable()</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://wasm4.org/docs/reference/functions/#update"><code>unsafe fn update</code></a> is the main entry point into our program, WASM-4 calls this function on each frame.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To compile and run our game we can build it just like any other crate:</p>
<pre data-lang="bash" style="background-color:#191919;color:#f8f8f2;" class="language-bash "><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span> </span><span style="color:#e9fdac;">$</span><span> cargo run</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#fc9354;"> --release
</span></code></pre>
<p>This will launch an empty window, and if we press the up arrow on the keyboard a vertical line will appear in all its green Gameboy-ish style.</p>
<p><img src="https://grantshandy.github.io/raycasting/screenshot-one.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Great, now that we've got the workflow down we can get to writing the game.</p>
<h3 id="storing-the-map">Storing The Map</h3>
<p>The simplest way to store the map is a grid of wall or no wall. One way we could store the map as <code>[[bool; WIDTH]; HEIGHT]</code> and access it through <code>map[][]</code>.
Storing the map this way wouldn't be very elegant because we'd have to type out each cell individually as a <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>Because the boolean value (wall or no wall) can be represented by a single bit we can use the bits inside of a number to represent the map: <code>[&lt;int&gt;; HEIGHT]</code>.
In this case, <code>[u16; HEIGHT]</code> can represent a map with a width of 16 cells and an arbitrary height of our choosing.
Using Rust's integer literal syntax we can represent our map pretty simply by writing a <code>1</code> where there is a wall and a <code>0</code> where there is no wall:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust" style="background-color:#191919;color:#f8f8f2;" class="language-rust "><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="font-style:italic;color:#fbdfb5;">const </span><span style="color:#fdb082;">MAP</span><span>: [</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#fbdfb5;">u16</span><span>; </span><span style="color:#fdb082;">8</span><span>] </span><span style="color:#ff5e5e;">= </span><span>[

</span><span>];
</span></code></pre>
<p>The more difficult thing about this way of storing the map is accessing it.
To do this we have to write a function that first indexes into the row then into the specific column by masking and then shifting the row.
This post is already long as it is so for the sake of time I'm not going to go in-depth about how the X coordinate lookup bit operations works in this function.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust" style="background-color:#191919;color:#f8f8f2;" class="language-rust "><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="color:#6d6d6d;">/// Check if the map contains a wall at a point.

</span><span>    }
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Because our map is surrounded by walls it's safe to tell the caller of this function that there is a wall if it calls for a coordinate that is out of bounds.</p>
<h3 id="maintaining-game-state">Maintaining Game State</h3>
<p>The map stays constant throughout the runtime of the program, but the player's position and angle change.
Because WASM-4 calls <code>update</code> on each frame the only way to store our game state across frames is via something like Rust's <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/static-items.html"><code>static mut</code></a>.
Because <code>static mut</code> is <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html"><code>unsafe</code></a> we should consolidate our game logic and state in a single <code>struct</code> so we minimize the number of times we modify our state through <code>static mut</code>.</p>
<p>Only three variables are required to describe the player's view: the X and Y position and viewing angle.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust" style="background-color:#191919;color:#f8f8f2;" class="language-rust "><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="font-style:italic;color:#fbdfb5;">struct </span><span>State {

</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#e9fdac;">player_y</span><span>: </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#fbdfb5;">f32</span><span>,
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#e9fdac;">player_angle</span><span>: </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#fbdfb5;">f32</span><span>,
</span><span>}    
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now let's initialize a <code>State</code> in a global <code>static mut</code>:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust" style="background-color:#191919;color:#f8f8f2;" class="language-rust "><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="font-style:italic;color:#fbdfb5;">static </span><span style="color:#ff5e5e;">mut </span><span style="color:#fdb082;">STATE</span><span>: State </span><span style="color:#ff5e5e;">=</span><span> State {
</span><span>    player_x: </span><span style="color:#fdb082;">1.5</span><span>,
</span><span>    player_y: </span><span style="color:#fdb082;">1.5</span><span>,
</span><span>    player_angle: </span><span style="color:#fdb082;">0.0</span><span>,
</span><span>};
</span></code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><em><code>player_x</code> and <code>player_y</code> are both initially set at 1.5 so the player starts in the center of a cell and not inside a wall.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only is accessing <code>State</code> <code>unsafe</code> behavior, most interactions with are WASM-4 are. (dereferencing raw pointers, calling external functions, etc.)</p>
<p>For those not familiar with Rust, <code>unsafe</code> is a keyword/block that you give the compiler when you need to get around its memory safety guarantees.
Using <code>unsafe</code> tells the Rust compiler "I know what I'm doing, don't bother me about it".
The problem is that often we don't know what we're doing.
Because of this, best practice is to keep <code>unsafe</code> usage to a minimum.</p>
<p>If we consolidate <code>unsafe</code> behavior into <code>fn update</code> and game logic into <code>State</code> we isolate our state and give some structure to our program.
This gives us a pretty clear line: <code>unsafe</code> I/O with WASM-4 in <code>fn update</code>, safe game logic in <code>State</code>.</p>

<h3 id="moving-the-character">Moving the Character</h3>
<p>One of the easier parts of this game is moving the character.
Because accessing our <code>STATE</code> from outside is <code>unsafe</code>, let's create a method inside of <code>State</code> to move the character and pass in the inputs on each frame.</p>

<p>If you've ever moved a player in a game and know some basic trigonometry this should all look familiar.
Note that calls to <code>sinf</code> are negative because our Y-axis is flipped.</p>
<p>If the player is asking us to move the player forwards or backward we modify the player's x and y positions based on the <code>cosf</code> and <code>sinf</code> values of the player's angle multiplied by a constant <code>STEP_SIZE</code>.</p>
<p>Just for you, I'll give you a magic number that works pretty well.
You can change later it if you'd like:</p>

<p>The last thing that we need to make this function work is to import <code>cosf</code> and <code>sinf</code> from <code>libm</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Why <code>sinf/cosf</code> and not <code>sin/cos</code>? This naming convention comes from C's libm where <code>sin/cos</code> handles doubles and <code>sinf/cosf</code> handles floats.</em>
<em>In Rust's implementation of <code>libm</code> this means <code>fn cos(x: f64) -&gt; f64</code> and <code>fn cosf(x: f32) -&gt; f32</code>.</em>
<em>We're using <code>f32</code> and not <code>f64</code> here because it saves space and we don't need the precision.</em></p>

<h3 id="horizontal-intersections-1">Horizontal Intersections</h3>
<p>Before we draw the walls on the screen we need to implement the core of our algorithm: horizontal and vertical intersection checks.</p>
<p>First, we need to expand our <code>libm</code> import statement from earlier:</p>

<p>Because we need to access the player's angle and position, let's create a method inside of <code>State</code> called <code>horizontal_intersection</code>.

<h3 id="getting-the-view">Getting The View</h3>
<p>So far we haven't written anything we can interact with.
Well, we can <em>act</em> on it (move the character), but we can't see what we're doing.
Let's try drawing the walls.</p>
<p>If you remember from the <a href="https://grantshandy.github.io/raycasting/#summary">summary</a>, we have to draw vertical lines for every column on the window.</p>
<p>We can split this up into two separate jobs: getting the heights of the lines and actually drawing them on the screen.
Why not do this all at once?
Well, <code>vline</code> is <code>unsafe</code> so we should keep it in <code>fn update</code>.</p>
<p>Let's do this by defining <code>State::get_view</code> which returns a list of all the wall heights.
Then, on each frame, we can call <code>State::get_view</code> from <code>fn update</code> and draw all of those vertical lines we just calculated.</p>

<p><code>State::get_view</code> will work by going through each vertical line on the screen (all 160), calculating the angle offset from the player's point of view, then finding the distance to the closest horizontal and vertical intersections with walls in the ray's path.
Then it compares the two distances and turns the smaller of the two into the height of a wall.</p>
<p>I know that sounds complicated so let's go ahead and write out what that looks like.</p>
<p>First, let's create some constants which define our player's perspective:</p>

<p>Looks good, let's try running it!
You can use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the player around.</p>
<p><img src="https://grantshandy.github.io/raycasting/first-attempt.gif" alt="first attempt" /></p>
<p>Wow, we were able to create the illusion of depth!
This is pretty impressive for our first try.
Most tutorials stop here, but there are some problems we need to work out.</p>
<h2 id="fixing-the-perspective">Fixing The Perspective</h2>
<p>When walking around you might notice that everything looks... wrong.
Walls bend away from you as if you were looking through a fisheye lens.</p>
<p><img src="https://grantshandy.github.io/raycasting/fisheye.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This is because our algorithm's assumption that human vision converges on a single infinitely small point (the player) is wrong.
In reality, our visual cortex is constantly blending the perspective of both of our eyes to create depth.</p>
<p>In this case a much more accurate metaphor is a plane  perpendicular to our perspective sending out the rays:</p>
<p><img src="https://grantshandy.github.io/raycasting/figure-perspective.svg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Of course this is pretty vague, but if you think of it as "fisheye correction" maybe that'll help.
To apply this "fisheye correction" we have to multiply the distance by the cosine of difference between the ray's angle and the player's angle:</p>
<p>$$ H= \frac{C}{D \times \cos(\Delta \theta)} $$</p>
<p>Where $H$ is the wall height in pixels, $D$ is the distance to the wall, and $ \Delta\theta$ is the difference between the ray's angle and the player's angle.</p>
<p>All we have to do to apply this is to modify a single line in the <code>State::get_view</code> function:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust" style="background-color:#191919;color:#f8f8f2;" class="language-rust "><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="color:#ff5e5e;">*</span><span>wall </span><span style="color:#ff5e5e;">= </span><span>( </span><span style="color:#fdb082;">WALL_HEIGHT </span><span style="color:#ff5e5e;">/ </span><span>(</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#fbdfb5;">f32</span><span>::min(h_dist, v_dist) </span><span style="color:#ff5e5e;">* </span><span style="color:#6699cc;">cosf</span><span>(angle </span><span style="color:#ff5e5e;">- </span><span style="color:#e9fdac;">self</span><span>.player_angle)) ) </span><span style="color:#ff5e5e;">as </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#fbdfb5;">i32</span><span>;    
</span></code></pre>
<p><img src="https://grantshandy.github.io/raycasting/corrected.png" alt="corrected" /></p>
<p>Great! Now the walls are straight.</p>
<h2 id="adding-some-depth">Adding Some Depth</h2>
<p>One thing about the current version of the game is that it is difficult to distinguish between different walls.
Especially at a distance, walls seem to fade into each other and it's hard to tell them apart.</p>
<p><img src="https://grantshandy.github.io/raycasting/nodepth.png" alt="nodepth" /></p>
<p>In real life, we can distinguish walls apart by their shadows.
We can try to emulate this in the game by coloring walls differently based on their orientation.
Luckily for us, we already know which walls are "east/west facing" and which are "north/south facing" because of what axis our rays intersected with them!
Knowing this, it's fairly easy to assign different colors to walls.</p>
<p>WASM-4 has a very unique way of setting which color its functions use to draw.
Every time a draw function is called in WASM-4 it decides what color to use based on an index kept a bit of memory called <code>DRAW_COLORS</code>.
WASM-4 makes changing <code>DRAW_COLORS</code> easy, we can set it by using simple hex notation.</p>
<p>Let's add <code>DRAW_COLORS</code> next to <code>GAMEPAD1</code> at the top of our file:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust" style="background-color:#191919;color:#f8f8f2;" class="language-rust "><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="font-style:italic;color:#fbdfb5;">const </span><span style="color:#fdb082;">DRAW_COLORS</span><span>: </span><span style="color:#ff5e5e;">*mut </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#fbdfb5;">u16 </span><span style="color:#ff5e5e;">= </span><span style="color:#fdb082;">0x14 </span><span style="color:#ff5e5e;">as *mut </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#fbdfb5;">u16</span><span>;

</span></code></pre>
<p>Now, in <code>State::get_view</code>, we can rewrite it to pass along if the wall should be drawn "with a shadow" or not:</p>

<p>Wow, that looks much better.
Even though shadows in real life don't act like this it adds some good detail and helps create the illusion of depth.</p>
<h2 id="making-it-smaller">Making It Smaller!</h2>
<p>If you were to check the size of the program right now, say by calling <code>du -bh</code>, you might get something like this:</p>
<pre data-lang="bash" style="background-color:#191919;color:#f8f8f2;" class="language-bash "><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span> </span><span style="color:#e9fdac;">$</span><span> du</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#fc9354;"> -bh</span><span> target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/raycaster.wasm

</span></code></pre>
<p>This is nowhere near the 2K executable I promised in the title, so how are we going to get there?
One way you can reduce the size of <code>.wasm</code> files is by using <code>wasm-opt</code>.
You can usually get <code>wasm-opt</code> by installing the <a href="https://pkgs.org/download/binaryen"><code>binaryen</code></a> package.
<code>wasm-opt</code> was specifically designed to optimize <code>.wasm</code> files for size by removing dead code and duplicate instructions that the compiler left behind.</p>
<p>Let's try using <code>wasm-opt</code> to reduce the size of the <code>.wasm</code>:</p>
<pre data-lang="bash" style="background-color:#191919;color:#f8f8f2;" class="language-bash "><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span> </span><span style="color:#e9fdac;">$</span><span> wasm-opt</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#fc9354;"> -Oz</span><span> target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/raycaster.wasm \

</span></code></pre>
<p>Hmmm, not quite enough.</p>
<h2 id="somehow-even-smaller">Somehow Even Smaller?!</h2>
<p>If you were to look into the executable you'd probably see that most of the space is being taken up by functions we imported from <code>libm</code>.
The final step requires we remove <code>libm</code> completely and replace it with our own implementation.</p>
<p>Let's start by deleting the old <code>libm</code> import statement and removing it from <code>Cargo.toml</code>.
After that we can add an approximation of the <code>sinf</code> function using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhaskara_I%27s_sine_approximation_formula">Bhaskara I's sin approximation</a> and redefine <code>cosf</code> and <code>tanf</code> in terms of it.</p>
<p>$$
\sin(x) \approx \frac{16x(\pi-x)}{5\pi^2-4x(\pi-x)} \text{ when } (0 \le x \le \pi)
$$</p>
<p>This approximation is very good, especially for the time it was discovered :).
And because we're operating with wall heights only between integers 0 and 160, any differences between <code>libm::sinf</code> and our <code>sinf</code> will be indistinguishable.</p>
<p>First, make sure to also import $\tau$ from the core library and define a constant for $5\pi^2$ which Bhaskara I's approximation uses:</p>

<p>Now we can create <code>cosf</code> and <code>tanf</code> functions from their definitions relating to <code>sinf</code>:</p>
<p>$\cos(x) = \sin(x + \frac{\pi}{2})$</p>

</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Alright, now that we've replaced the <code>libm</code> trig functions, what about <code>sqrtf</code>, <code>ceilf</code>, <code>floorf</code>, and <code>fabsf</code>?
This is where <em>nightly</em> Rust is required, so make sure you've switched you've installed <code>wasm32-unknown-unknown</code> for nightly and build on nightly each time with <code>+nightly</code>:</p>
<pre data-lang="bash" style="background-color:#191919;color:#f8f8f2;" class="language-bash "><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span> </span><span style="color:#e9fdac;">$</span><span> rustup +nightly install wasm32-unknown-unknown
</span></code></pre>
<pre data-lang="bash" style="background-color:#191919;color:#f8f8f2;" class="language-bash "><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span> </span><span style="color:#e9fdac;">$</span><span> cargo +nightly build</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#fc9354;"> --release
</span></code></pre>
<p>Nightly Rust enables us to use an experimental module in the core library named <code>core::intrinsics</code>.
<code>core::intrinsics</code> provides us some functions that the compiler knows how to optimize so we don't have to write them ourself.
In order to turn on the experimental intrinsics feature, add <code>#![feature(core_intrinsics)]</code> to the top of your file:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust" style="background-color:#191919;color:#f8f8f2;" class="language-rust "><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span>#![</span><span style="color:#e9fdac;">no_main</span><span>]
</span><span>#![</span><span style="color:#e9fdac;">no_std</span><span>]
</span><span>#![</span><span style="color:#e9fdac;">feature</span><span>(core_intrinsics)]
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now we can create some "safe" wrappers over the unsafe functions that <code>core::intrinsics</code> provides for us:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust" style="background-color:#191919;color:#f8f8f2;" class="language-rust "><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="color:#6d6d6d;">// &gt;:)

</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#ff5e5e;">unsafe </span><span>{ core::intrinsics::sqrtf32(x) }
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#fbdfb5;">fn </span><span style="color:#8cdaff;">floorf</span><span>(</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#fc9354;">x</span><span>: </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#fbdfb5;">f32</span><span>) -&gt; </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#fbdfb5;">f32 </span><span>{
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#ff5e5e;">unsafe </span><span>{ core::intrinsics::floorf32(x) }
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#fbdfb5;">fn </span><span style="color:#8cdaff;">ceilf</span><span>(</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#fc9354;">x</span><span>: </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#fbdfb5;">f32</span><span>) -&gt; </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#fbdfb5;">f32 </span><span>{
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#ff5e5e;">unsafe </span><span>{ core::intrinsics::ceilf32(x) }
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#fbdfb5;">fn </span><span style="color:#8cdaff;">fabsf</span><span>(</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#fc9354;">x</span><span>: </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#fbdfb5;">f32</span><span>) -&gt; </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#fbdfb5;">f32 </span><span>{
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#ff5e5e;">unsafe </span><span>{ core::intrinsics::fabsf32(x) }
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Lets compile to and see if it works... and</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>1.7K is not the smallest you can make this program.
You can get this to fit in even smaller sizes and I encourage you to try!
There are some sections in this code that I've even intentionally made more readable at the cost of taking up slightly more instructions than they need to just so you can optimize it :)</p>
<p>I wrote this post because when I was first writing my raycasted game I couldn't find any resources that explained how the algorithm worked in sane code and plain language.</p>
<p>I hope this was interesting and useful for you!
Ray casting (like in this simple way) in FPS games was always a mystery to me before I looked into them, I hope you'll agree that the algorithm behind it is surprisingly elegant.</p>
