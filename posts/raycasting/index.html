<a href=#introduction class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>On first glance, making a first person game without an engine or a graphics API seems like an almost impossible task.
In this post I&rsquo;ll show you how to do that using an algorithm called ray casting.</p><p>My goal here is to show how something that looks complicated can be broken down into simple pieces,
and if I&rsquo;ve done my job right, it should feel like you&rsquo;ve <em>discovered</em> how the game works.</p><p>First, we&rsquo;ll explore how the algorithm behind the game works, then we&rsquo;ll write it out line by line.
Afterwards, we&rsquo;ll take a second look at the code to add some features and optimize it for size.
I&rsquo;ve tried to make this as accessible and friendly as possible but a healthy understanding of programming as well as Rust and basic geometry will help.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a quick preview of what we&rsquo;ll be making:</p><figure class=center><video style=border-radius:8px;transform:translateX(-25%);-webkit-transform:translateX(-25%);margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=200% height=200% autoplay loop muted>
<source src=preview.webm type=video/webm></video></figure><p>My first experience with games like this (though I didn&rsquo;t know at the time), was in middle school with games like <a href=https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/360/36062.html rel=noopener target=_blank>zDoom</a> on my calculator.
zDoom (while not actually that fun), was fascinating to me because it could (kind of) create the illusion of depth and perspective, something I thought only &ldquo;real&rdquo; games could do.</p><figure class=center><img style=max-width:100%;width:auto;height:auto;border-radius:8px src=/posts/raycasting/zdoom_hucd3a988ec9303721f97c0417fb7ec03b_652_250x0_resize_box_3.png width=250 height=167></figure><p>zDoom was only an imitation of the original game Doom, in reality, it was much closer to Doom&rsquo;s predecessor, Wolfenstein 3D.</p><h3 id=wolfenstein-3d>Wolfenstein 3D
<a href=#wolfenstein-3d class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h3><p>Famously, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D rel=noopener target=_blank>Wolfenstein 3D</a>, released in 1992, was one of the first 3D first-person games to run on consumer PCs.
Back then, computers didn&rsquo;t have hardware 3D acceleration, let alone dedicated graphics cards, so how was this done?</p><figure class=center><img src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/Wolf3d_pc.png><figcaption class=center>A screenshot from wolfenstein 3D</figcaption></figure><p>Well, I should have said <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2.5D rel=noopener target=_blank><em>pseudo</em>-3D</a> because no part of the game ran in three dimensions.
The core of the game was an algorithm called ray casting<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>, a process of projecting a 2D game into a 3D perspective.</p><p>All the game entities were located at simple x and y positions on the map and could not move vertically.
Upon release, I&rsquo;m sure that this didn&rsquo;t matter, but with our current standards, it shows its age.
The player could not look up or down, let alone crouch or jump.</p><figure class=center><img src=wolfenstein-map.png><figcaption class=center>A top-down view of the first level of Wolfenstein 3D</figcaption></figure><p>To add to that, all the levels were composed of single floors of buildings with no windows.
Also, all walls were perfectly straight with corners placed at even intervals (something that will absolutely not come up later).
These design features were all put here because of some of the essential restrictions of its simple ray-casting algorithm.</p><h2 id=the-algorithm>The Algorithm
<a href=#the-algorithm class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><h3 id=the-basics>The Basics
<a href=#the-basics class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h3><p>At the most fundamental level, ray casting depends on the simple fact that objects that are further away from us appear smaller while objects that are closer appear larger.
Ray casting uses this fact to draw walls at shorter heights the further away they are from the player and at taller heights the closer they are.</p><p>Just this simple idea alone creates a convincing illusion of depth and allows us to move our player around just as if it were being rendered in actual 3D.</p><p>Ray casting <em>works</em> by tracing a path from the player to the closest wall for each column in the player&rsquo;s view.
It then records the distances of each path before converting it into the height of a wall and drawing it on the screen as a vertical line.</p><figure class=center><img src=figure-overview.svg></figure><p>From what we know so far about the ray casting algorithm we can deduce that we will need to:</p><ul><li>Cast a ray from the player and stop at the nearest wall</li><li>Calculate the distance from the player to the nearest wall</li><li>Convert that distance into the height of a wall and draw it on the screen</li><li>Repeat that for each column on the screen ↺</li></ul><h3 id=digging-deeper>Digging Deeper
<a href=#digging-deeper class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h3><p>The hardest part of this is &ldquo;cast a ray from the player and stop at the nearest wall&rdquo;.
This seems simple on paper but in practice, it can be <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_detection rel=noopener target=_blank>pretty difficult</a>.
If you had to come up with a ray casting implementation yourself, how would you approach it?</p><figure class=center><img src=figure-question.svg><figcaption class=center>The Intersection Problem</figcaption></figure><p>The first idea most people would probably have is to repeatedly extend the ray<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> a small amount and stop when it hits a wall.
This is problematic because we might skip over the wall entirely when extending the ray.
And if the ray does hit the wall correctly it will have very low accuracy because it won&rsquo;t know exactly where the wall started, just that it landed in one.</p><figure class=center><img src=figure-naive.svg><figcaption class=center>The Naive Solution</figcaption></figure><p>What we need is to find a way that we can <em>guarantee</em> that the ray will intersect with a wall and that it will stop right on the border of that wall.
In math land, we might be able to do this by extending the ray an infinitely small distance infinitely many times.
Sadly, we&rsquo;re not in math land so we can&rsquo;t do that.</p><p>The solution to this, as you might have guessed from the earlier foreshadowing, is to align all the walls to a grid.
If we know that the walls fall at predictable intervals we can calculate a reliable distance to extend our ray each time.</p><figure class=center><img src=figure-solution.svg><figcaption class=center>Notice a pattern?</figcaption></figure><p>But how will the ray jump to the wall?</p><p>If you get out some grid paper and sketch out the lines between the player to various walls you&rsquo;ll start to notice some patterns.
Ray &ldquo;extensions&rdquo; on their way to walls on horizontal grid lines all share a common width while ray &ldquo;extensions&rdquo; that land on walls at vertical grid lines all share a common height.</p><p>Once we extend the ray to the first grid line we can calculate these shared &ldquo;extension widths&rdquo; and &ldquo;extension heights&rdquo;.
Then we repeatedly extend it by these widths and heights to get the closest &ldquo;vertical wall&rdquo; and &ldquo;horizontal wall&rdquo; then use the smaller of the two distances.</p><p>I admit this is a bit confusing so I&rsquo;ll explain what this means in more depth:</p><h3 id=horizontal-intersections>Horizontal Intersections
<a href=#horizontal-intersections class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h3><p>Here&rsquo;s an example diagram of what it looks like when a player looks at a &ldquo;horizontal wall&rdquo;.
This diagram is interactive, try dragging around the player!</p><script>window.addEventListener("load",function(){new GGBApplet({appName:"geometry",id:"horizontal",width:800,height:600,showToolBar:!1,showZoomButtons:!1,showAlgebraInput:!1,showLogging:!1,enableRightClick:!1,enableShiftDragZoom:!1,preventFocus:!0,showMenuBar:!1,appletOnLoad:e=>{e.setCoordSystem(-2.78,13.18,-4.48,7.48)},filename:"https://grantshandy.github.io/ggb/horizontal.ggb"}).inject("horizontal")})</script><figure class=center><div id=horizontal style=border-radius:8px;overflow:hidden></div><figcaption class=center>Notice how only the <em>width</em> between extensions changes when the player moves.</figcaption></figure><p>In horizontal wall intersections the height between &ldquo;extensions&rdquo; is always one, while the width between extensions can be derived from the angle of the ray.
We always move up or down by exactly one and right or left by an amount determined by the angle of the ray.</p><p>You can see this by looking at the diagram, the width between $A_x$ and $B_x$ is the same as the width between $B_x$ and $C_x$, and the difference in height between all the points is just one.</p><p>Using some simple trigonometry we can find the width between horizontal grid intersections from the angle of the player.
I&rsquo;m going to save you the work and just give you the definition:</p><p>$$ \Delta H = \begin{cases} 1 &\text{if &ldquo;facing up&rdquo;} \\ -1 &\text{if &ldquo;facing down&rdquo;} \end{cases} $$
$$ \Delta W = \frac{\Delta H}{\tan(\theta)} $$</p><h3 id=vertical-intersections>Vertical Intersections
<a href=#vertical-intersections class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h3><p>Here&rsquo;s another interactive diagram of what it looks like when a ray intersects with a &ldquo;vertical wall&rdquo;.</p><script>window.addEventListener("load",function(){new GGBApplet({appName:"geometry",id:"vertical",width:800,height:600,showToolBar:!1,showZoomButtons:!1,showAlgebraInput:!1,showLogging:!1,enableRightClick:!1,enableShiftDragZoom:!1,preventFocus:!0,showMenuBar:!1,appletOnLoad:e=>{e.setCoordSystem(-3.097,8.238,2.274,10.769)},filename:"https://grantshandy.github.io/ggb/vertical.ggb"}).inject("vertical")})</script><figure class=center><div id=vertical style=border-radius:8px;overflow:hidden></div><figcaption class=center>Here the <em>height</em> between extensions changes while the width stays the same.</figcaption></figure><p>Vertical grid intersections are the same as horizontal grid intersections, just rotated 90°.
In vertical grid intersections the <em>width</em> between our &ldquo;ray extensions&rdquo; is constant while the <em>height</em> is created from the angle of the ray.
Like last time, I&rsquo;m going to skip ahead and define our variables for you.</p><p>$$ \Delta W = \begin{cases} 1 &\text{if &ldquo;facing right&rdquo;} \\ -1 &\text{if &ldquo;facing left&rdquo;} \end{cases} $$
$$ \Delta H = \Delta W * \tan(\theta) $$</p><h3 id=summary>Summary
<a href=#summary class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h3><p>Now that we know pretty much exactly how we&rsquo;ll do this we can compile it into a more detailed step-by-step list for our program to execute on each frame.</p><p>For each column on the screen:</p><ol><li>Find the angle for the ray from the player&rsquo;s angle and field of view.</li><li>Determine the distance to the nearest wall that the ray intersects with:<ul><li>Get the first &ldquo;horizontal&rdquo; wall the ray intersects with.</li><li>Get the first &ldquo;vertical&rdquo; wall the ray intersects with.</li><li>Calculate the distance to the wall from the closest of those two.</li></ul></li><li>Convert that distance into the height of a wall on the screen and then draw it.</li></ol><h2 id=implementation>Implementation
<a href=#implementation class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>Now that we understand how the underlying algorithm works we can write a program that implements it using WASM-4.</p><p>Wait why WASM-4?
The official answer is that we need a way for our program to accept user input and draw to the screen.
The real answer is because I like it a lot.</p><p><a href=https://wasm4.org rel=noopener target=_blank>WASM-4</a> is a tiny game engine that runs WebAssembly (<code>.wasm</code>) files.
Most compiled programming languages (C, C++, Rust, Zig, etc.) can compile to WebAssembly which means games for WASM-4 can be written in any of those languages!
WASM-4 is <em>extremely</em> minimal, the &ldquo;4&rdquo; in &ldquo;WASM-4&rdquo; is there because you can only draw four colors on screen at once.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll be using Rust, but you could follow along with any language that can compile to WebAssembly.
If you&rsquo;re more familiar with JavaScript I recommend <a href=https://assemblyscript.org rel=noopener target=_blank>AssemblyScript</a>.</p><div class=mermaid style=text-align:center>graph LR
source[lib.rs] --> compiler[rustc] --> wasm
subgraph wasm4[WASM-4]
wasm[game.wasm]
end
wasm4--> player[Player]</div><p>WASM-4 will let us create <em>tiny</em> games because it provides a simple platform to build off.
WASM-4 handles windowing, graphics rendering, and gamepad input, we have to do everything else.</p><p>Here are the specs for the WASM-4 &ldquo;fantasy console&rdquo; from the website:</p><blockquote><ul><li>Display: 160x160 pixels, 4 customizable colors, updated at 60 Hz.</li><li>Memory: 64 KB linear RAM, memory-mapped I/O, save states.</li><li>Cartridge Size Limit: 64 KB.</li><li>Input: Keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, up to 4 gamepads.</li><li>Audio: 2 pulse wave channels, 1 triangle wave channel, 1 noise channel.</li><li>Disk Storage: 1024 bytes.</li></ul></blockquote><p>If you know a bit about computer hardware you&rsquo;ll know this is an <em>incredibly</em> restrictive environment for a game to run in.
That&rsquo;s the fun of it though, seeing how much you can cram into 160x160px, 4 colors, and 64KB of disk space.
If you want to see what people are able to create with it, check out the <a href=https://wasm4.org/play rel=noopener target=_blank>WASM-4 site</a> for some very impressive games (including a flight simulator!).</p><p>I&rsquo;ll probably make a more in-depth post on WASM-4 in the future, but for now, this explanation should be good enough for our case.
All you need to run WASM-4 games is to <a href=https://wasm4.org/docs/getting-started/setup>download and install the minimal runtime</a>.</p><h3 id=project-setup>Project Setup

<a href=#storing-the-map class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h3><p>The simplest way to store the map is a grid of wall or no wall. One way we could store the map as <code>[[bool; WIDTH]; HEIGHT]</code> and access it through <code>map[][]</code>.
Storing the map this way wouldn&rsquo;t be very elegant because we&rsquo;d have to type out each cell individually as a <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p><p>Because the boolean value (wall or no wall) can be represented by a single bit we can use the bits inside of a number to represent the map: <code>[u16; HEIGHT]</code>.
In this case, <code>[u16; HEIGHT]</code> can represent a map with a width of 16 cells and an arbitrary height of our choosing.
Using Rust&rsquo;s integer literal syntax we can represent our map pretty simply by writing a <code>1</code> where there is a wall and a <code>0</code> where there is no wall:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-rust data-lang=rust><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#66d9ef>const</span> MAP: [<span style=color:#66d9ef>u16</span>; <span style=color:#ae81ff>8</span>] <span style=color:#f92672>=</span> [

Because <code>static mut</code> is <a href=https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html rel=noopener target=_blank><code>unsafe</code></a> we should consolidate our game logic and state in a single <code>struct</code> so we minimize the number of times we modify our state through <code>static mut</code>.</p><p>Only three variables are required to describe the player&rsquo;s view: the X and Y position and viewing angle.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-rust data-lang=rust><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#66d9ef>struct</span> <span style=color:#a6e22e>State</span> {

(dereferencing raw pointers, calling external functions, etc.)</p><p>For those not familiar with Rust, <code>unsafe</code> is a keyword/block that you give the compiler when you need to get around its memory safety guarantees.
Using <code>unsafe</code> tells the Rust compiler &ldquo;I know what I&rsquo;m doing, don&rsquo;t bother me about it&rdquo;.
The problem is that often we don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re doing.
Because of this, best practice is to keep <code>unsafe</code> usage to a minimum.</p><p>If we consolidate <code>unsafe</code> behavior into <code>fn update</code> and game logic into <code>State</code> we isolate our state and give some structure to our program.
This gives us a pretty clear line: <code>unsafe</code> I/O with WASM-4 in <code>fn update</code>, safe game logic in <code>State</code>.</p><div class=mermaid style=text-align:center>flowchart

<a href=#adding-some-depth class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>One thing about the current version of the game is that it is difficult to distinguish between different walls.
Especially at a distance, walls seem to fade into each other and it&rsquo;s hard to tell them apart.</p><figure class=center><img style=max-width:100%;width:auto;height:auto;border-radius:8px src=/posts/raycasting/nodepth_hu33c8e768c3a605f6dbc2d1420ad25207_1249_325x0_resize_box_3.png width=325 height=325></figure><p>In real life, we can distinguish walls apart by their shadows.
We can try to emulate this in the game by coloring walls differently based on their orientation.
Luckily for us, we already know which walls are &ldquo;east/west facing&rdquo; and which are &ldquo;north/south facing&rdquo; because of what axis our rays intersected with them!
Knowing this, it&rsquo;s fairly easy to assign different colors to walls.</p><p>WASM-4 has a very unique way of setting which color its functions use to draw.
Every time a draw function is called in WASM-4 it decides what color to use based on an index kept a bit of memory called <code>DRAW_COLORS</code>.
WASM-4 makes changing <code>DRAW_COLORS</code> easy, we can set it by using simple hex notation.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s add <code>DRAW_COLORS</code> next to <code>GAMEPAD1</code> at the top of our file:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-rust data-lang=rust><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#66d9ef>const</span> DRAW_COLORS: <span style=color:#f92672>*</span><span style=color:#66d9ef>mut</span> <span style=color:#66d9ef>u16</span> <span style=color:#f92672>=</span> <span style=color:#ae81ff>0x14</span> <span style=color:#66d9ef>as</span> <span style=color:#f92672>*</span><span style=color:#66d9ef>mut</span> <span style=color:#66d9ef>u16</span>;

<a href=#somehow-even-smaller class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>If you were to look into the executable you&rsquo;d probably see that most of the space is being taken up by functions we imported from <code>libm</code>.
The final step requires we remove <code>libm</code> completely and replace it with our own implementation.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s start by deleting the old <code>libm</code> import statement and removing it from <code>Cargo.toml</code>.
After that we can add an approximation of the <code>sinf</code> function using <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhaskara_I%27s_sine_approximation_formula rel=noopener target=_blank>Bhasksara I&rsquo;s sin approximation</a> and redefine <code>cosf</code> and <code>tanf</code> in terms of it.</p><p>$$
\sin(x) \approx \frac{16x(\pi-x)}{5\pi^2-4x(\pi-x)} \text{ when } (0 \le x \le \pi)
$$</p><p>This approximation is <em>extremely</em> good, especially for the time it was discovered.
And because we&rsquo;re operating with wall heights only between 0 and 160, any differences between <code>libm::sinf</code> and our <code>sinf</code> will be indistinguishable.</p><p>First, make sure to also import $\tau$ from the core library and define a constant for $5\pi^2$ which Bhaskara I&rsquo;s approximation uses:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-rust data-lang=rust><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#66d9ef>use</span> core::<span style=color:#66d9ef>f32</span>::consts::{FRAC_PI_2, PI, TAU};
