In this post I'll show you how to do that using an algorithm called ray casting.<p>My goal here is to show how something that looks complicated can be broken down into simple pieces, and if I've done my job right, it should feel like you've <em>discovered</em> how the game works.<p>First, we'll explore how the algorithm behind the game works, then we'll write it out line by line. Afterwards, we'll take a second look at the code to add some features and optimize it for size. I've tried to make this as accessible and friendly as possible but a healthy understanding of programming as well as Rust and basic geometry will help.<p>Here's a quick preview of what we'll be making:<figure class="mx-auto rounded-md flex w-3/4"><video class="rounded-md flex-grow"autoplay loop muted><source src=./img/preview.webm type=video/webm></video></figure><p>If you just want to see the source code, you can check out the <a href=https://github.com/grantshandy/wasm4-raycaster>Github repository</a>.<p>My first experience with games like this (though I didn't know at the time), was in middle school with games like <a href=https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/360/36062.html>zDoom</a> on my calculator. zDoom (while not actually that fun), was fascinating to me because it could (kind of) create the illusion of depth and perspective, something I thought only "real" games could do.<p><img alt=zDoom src=./img/zdoom.png><p>zDoom was only an imitation of the original game Doom, in reality, it was much closer to Doom's predecessor, Wolfenstein 3D.<h3 id=wolfenstein-3d><a href=https://grantshandy.github.io/posts/raycasting/#wolfenstein-3d>Wolfenstein 3D</a></h3><p>Famously, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D>Wolfenstein 3D</a>, released in 1992, was one of the first 3D first-person games to run on consumer PCs. Back then, computers didn't have hardware 3D acceleration, let alone dedicated graphics cards, so how was this done?<p><img alt="A wolfenstein 3D screenshot"src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/Wolf3d_pc.png><p>Well, I should have said <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2.5D><em>pseudo</em>-3D</a> because no part of the game ran in three dimensions. The core of the game was an algorithm called ray casting<sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#1>1</a></sup>, a process of projecting a 2D game into a 3D perspective.<p>All the game entities were located at simple x and y positions on the map and could not move vertically. Upon release, I'm sure that this didn't matter, but with our current standards, it shows its age. The player could not look up or down, let alone crouch or jump.<p><img alt="A top-down view of the first level of Wolfenstein 3D"src=./img/wolfenstein-map.png><p>To add to that, all the levels were composed of single floors of buildings with no windows. Also, all walls were perfectly straight with corners placed at even intervals (something that will absolutely not come up later). These design features were all put here because of some of the essential restrictions of its simple ray-casting algorithm.<h2 id=the-algorithm><a href=https://grantshandy.github.io/posts/raycasting/#the-algorithm>The Algorithm</a></h2><h3 id=the-basics><a href=https://grantshandy.github.io/posts/raycasting/#the-basics>The Basics</a></h3><p>At the most fundamental level, ray casting depends on the simple fact that objects that are further away from us appear smaller while objects that are closer appear larger. Ray casting uses this fact to draw walls at shorter heights the further away they are from the player and at taller heights the closer they are.<p>Just this simple idea alone creates a convincing illusion of depth and allows us to move our player around just as if it were being rendered in actual 3D.<p>Ray casting <em>works</em> by tracing a path from the player to the closest wall for each column in the player's view. It then records the distances of each path before converting it into the height of a wall and drawing it on the screen as a vertical line.<p><img alt="figure overview"src=./img/figure-overview.svg><p>From what we know so far about the ray casting algorithm we can deduce that we will need to:<ul><li>Cast a ray from the player and stop at the nearest wall<li>Calculate the distance from the player to the nearest wall<li>Convert that distance into the height of a wall and draw it on the screen<li>Repeat that for each column on the screen â†º</ul><h3 id=digging-deeper><a href=https://grantshandy.github.io/posts/raycasting/#digging-deeper>Digging Deeper</a></h3><p>The hardest part of this is "cast a ray from the player and stop at the nearest wall". This seems simple on paper but in practice, it can be <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_detection>pretty difficult</a>. If you had to come up with a ray casting implementation yourself, how would you approach it?<p><img alt="The Intersection Problem"src=./img/figure-question.svg><p>The first idea most people would probably have is to repeatedly extend the ray<sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#2>2</a></sup> a small amount and stop when it hits a wall. This is problematic because we might skip over the wall entirely when extending the ray. And if the ray does hit the wall correctly it will have very low accuracy because it won't know exactly where the wall started, just that it landed in one.<p><img alt="The Naive Solution"src=./img/figure-naive.svg><p>What we need is to find a way that we can <em>guarantee</em> that the ray will intersect with a wall and that it will stop right on the border of that wall. In math land, we might be able to do this by extending the ray an infinitely small distance infinitely many times. Sadly, we're not in math land so we can't do that.<p>The solution to this, as you might have guessed from the earlier foreshadowing, is to align all the walls to a grid. If we know that the walls fall at predictable intervals we can calculate a reliable distance to extend our ray each time.<p><img alt="Notice a pattern?"src=./img/figure-solution.svg><p>But how will the ray jump to the wall?<p>If you get out some grid paper and sketch out the lines between the player to various walls you'll start to notice some patterns. Ray "extensions" on their way to walls on horizontal grid lines all share a common width while ray "extensions" that land on walls at vertical grid lines all share a common height.<p>Once we extend the ray to the first grid line we can calculate these shared "extension widths" and "extension heights". Then we repeatedly extend it by these widths and heights to get the closest "vertical wall" and "horizontal wall" then use the smaller of the two distances.<p>I admit this is a bit confusing so I'll explain what this means in more depth:<h3 id=horizontal-intersections><a href=https://grantshandy.github.io/posts/raycasting/#horizontal-intersections>Horizontal Intersections</a></h3><p>Here's an example diagram of what it looks like when a player looks at a "horizontal wall". This diagram is interactive, try dragging around the player!</p><script>window.addEventListener("load", function() {

We always move up or down by exactly one and right or left by an amount determined by the angle of the ray.<p>You can see this by looking at the diagram, the width between $A_x$ and $B_x$ is the same as the width between $B_x$ and $C_x$, and the difference in height between all the points is just one.<p>Using some simple trigonometry we can find the width between horizontal grid intersections from the angle of the player. I'm going to save you the work and just give you the definition:<p>$$ \Delta H = \begin{cases} 1 &\text{if "facing up"} \\ -1 &\text{if "facing down"} \end{cases} $$ $$ \Delta W = \frac{\Delta H}{\tan(\theta)} $$<h3 id=vertical-intersections><a href=https://grantshandy.github.io/posts/raycasting/#vertical-intersections>Vertical Intersections</a></h3><p>Here's another interactive diagram of what it looks like when a ray intersects with a "vertical wall".</p><script>window.addEventListener("load", function() {

The official answer is that we need a way for our program to accept user input and draw to the screen. The real answer is because I like it a lot.<p><a href=https://wasm4.org>WASM-4</a> is a tiny game engine that runs WebAssembly (<code>.wasm</code>) files. Most compiled programming languages (C, C++, Rust, Zig, etc.) can compile to WebAssembly which means games for WASM-4 can be written in any of those languages! WASM-4 is <em>extremely</em> minimal, the "4" in "WASM-4" is there because you can only draw four colors on screen at once.<p>I'll be using Rust, but you could follow along with any language that can compile to WebAssembly. If you're more familiar with JavaScript I recommend <a href=https://assemblyscript.org>AssemblyScript</a>.<p><img src=./img/wasm4-demo.svg><p>WASM-4 will let us create <em>tiny</em> games because it provides a simple platform to build off. WASM-4 handles windowing, graphics rendering, and gamepad input, we have to do everything else.<p>Here are the specs for the WASM-4 "fantasy console" from the website:<blockquote><ul><li>Display: 160x160 pixels, 4 customizable colors, updated at 60 Hz.<li>Memory: 64 KB linear RAM, memory-mapped I/O, save states.<li>Cartridge Size Limit: 64 KB.<li>Input: Keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, up to 4 gamepads.<li>Audio: 2 pulse wave channels, 1 triangle wave channel, 1 noise channel.<li>Disk Storage: 1024 bytes.</ul></blockquote><p>If you know a bit about computer hardware you'll know this is an <em>incredibly</em> restrictive environment for a game to run in. That's the fun of it though, seeing how much you can cram into 160x160px, 4 colors, and 64KB of disk space. If you want to see what people are able to create with it, check out the <a href=https://wasm4.org/play>WASM-4 site</a> for some very impressive games (including a flight simulator!).<p>I'll probably make a more in-depth post on WASM-4 in the future, but for now, this explanation should be good enough for our case. All you need to run WASM-4 games is to <a href=https://wasm4.org/docs/getting-started/setup>download and install the minimal runtime</a>.<h3 id=project-setup><a href=https://grantshandy.github.io/posts/raycasting/#project-setup>Project Setup</a></h3><p>Because WASM-4 runs WebAssembly files we have to configure our project to create one.<pre class=language-sh data-lang=sh style=background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh><span style=color:#bf616a;>$</span><span> cargo new raycaster</span><span style=color:#bf616a;> --lib </span><span>&& </span><span style=color:#96b5b4;>cd</span><span> raycaster

One way we could store the map as <code>[[bool; WIDTH]; HEIGHT]</code> and access it through <code>map[][]</code>. Storing the map this way wouldn't be very elegant because we'd have to type out each cell individually as a <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.<p>Because the boolean value (wall or no wall) can be represented by a single bit we can use the bits inside of a number to represent the map: <code>[u16; HEIGHT]</code>. In this case, <code>[u16; HEIGHT]</code> can represent a map with a width of 16 cells and an arbitrary height of our choosing. Using Rust's integer literal syntax we can represent our map pretty simply by writing a <code>1</code> where there is a wall and a <code>0</code> where there is no wall:<pre class=language-rust data-lang=rust style=background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;><code class=language-rust data-lang=rust><span style=color:#b48ead;>const </span><span style=color:#d08770;>MAP</span><span>: [</span><span style=color:#b48ead;>u16</span><span>; </span><span style=color:#d08770;>8</span><span>] = [

To do this we have to write a function that first indexes into the row then into the specific column by masking and then shifting the row.

(dereferencing raw pointers, calling external functions, etc.)<p>For those not familiar with Rust, <code>unsafe</code> is a keyword/block that you give the compiler when you need to get around its memory safety guarantees. Using <code>unsafe</code> tells the Rust compiler "I know what I'm doing, don't bother me about it". The problem is that often we don't know what we're doing. Because of this, best practice is to keep <code>unsafe</code> usage to a minimum.<p>If we consolidate <code>unsafe</code> behavior into <code>fn update</code> and game logic into <code>State</code> we isolate our state and give some structure to our program.

Well, we can <em>act</em> on it (move the character), but we can't see what we're doing. Let's try drawing the walls.<p>If you remember from the <a href=https://grantshandy.github.io/posts/raycasting/#summary>summary</a>, we have to draw vertical lines for every column on the window.<p>We can split this up into two separate jobs: getting the heights of the lines and actually drawing them on the screen. Why not do this all at once? Well, <code>vline</code> is <code>unsafe</code> so we should keep it in <code>fn update</code>.<p>Let's do this by defining <code>State::get_view</code> which returns a list of all the wall heights. Then, on each frame, we can call <code>State::get_view</code> from <code>fn update</code> and draw all of those vertical lines we just calculated.<pre class=language-rust data-lang=rust style=background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;><code class=language-rust data-lang=rust><span>#[</span><span style=color:#bf616a;>no_mangle</span><span>]

Now the walls are straight.<h2 id=adding-some-depth><a href=https://grantshandy.github.io/posts/raycasting/#adding-some-depth>Adding Some Depth</a></h2><p>One thing about the current version of the game is that it is difficult to distinguish between different walls. Especially at a distance, walls seem to fade into each other and it's hard to tell them apart.<p><img alt=nodepth.png src=./img/nodepth.png><p>In real life, we can distinguish walls apart by their shadows. We can try to emulate this in the game by coloring walls differently based on their orientation. Luckily for us, we already know which walls are "east/west facing" and which are "north/south facing" because of what axis our rays intersected with them! Knowing this, it's fairly easy to assign different colors to walls.<p>WASM-4 has a very unique way of setting which color its functions use to draw. Every time a draw function is called in WASM-4 it decides what color to use based on an index kept a bit of memory called <code>DRAW_COLORS</code>. WASM-4 makes changing <code>DRAW_COLORS</code> easy, we can set it by using simple hex notation.<p>Let's add <code>DRAW_COLORS</code> next to <code>GAMEPAD1</code> at the top of our file:<pre class=language-rust data-lang=rust style=background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;><code class=language-rust data-lang=rust><span style=color:#b48ead;>const </span><span style=color:#d08770;>DRAW_COLORS</span><span>: </span><span style=color:#b48ead;>*mut u16 </span><span>= </span><span style=color:#d08770;>0x14 </span><span>as </span><span style=color:#b48ead;>*mut u16</span><span>;

The final step requires we remove <code>libm</code> completely and replace it with our own implementation.<p>Let's start by deleting the old <code>libm</code> import statement and removing it from <code>Cargo.toml</code>. After that we can add an approximation of the <code>sinf</code> function using <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhaskara_I%27s_sine_approximation_formula>Bhasksara I's sin approximation</a> and redefine <code>cosf</code> and <code>tanf</code> in terms of it.<p>$$ \sin(x) \approx \frac{16x(\pi-x)}{5\pi^2-4x(\pi-x)} \text{ when } (0 \le x \le \pi) $$<p>This approximation is <em>extremely</em> good, especially for the time it was discovered. And because we're operating with wall heights only between integers 0 and 160, any differences between <code>libm::sinf</code> and our <code>sinf</code> will be indistinguishable.<p>First, make sure to also import $\tau$ from the core library and define a constant for $5\pi^2$ which Bhaskara I's approximation uses:<pre class=language-rust data-lang=rust style=background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;><code class=language-rust data-lang=rust><span style=color:#b48ead;>use </span><span>core::f32::consts::{</span><span style=color:#d08770;>FRAC_PI_2</span><span>, </span><span style=color:#d08770;>PI</span><span>, </span><span style=color:#d08770;>TAU</span><span>};

There are some sections in this code that I've even intentionally made more readable at the cost of taking up slightly more instructions than they need to just so <em>you</em> can optimize it.<p>I wrote this post because when I was first writing my raycasted game I couldn't find any resources that explained how the algorithm worked in sane code and plain language.<p>I hope this was interesting and useful for you! Ray casting in FPS games was always a mystery to me before I looked into them, I hope you'll agree that the algorithm behind it is surprisingly elegant.</p><script data-text="Buy me a coffee"data-coffee-color=#FFDD00 data-color=#5F7FFF data-emoji data-font=Arial data-font-color=#ffffff data-name=bmc-button data-outline-color=#000000 data-slug=granthandy src=https://cdnjs.buymeacoffee.com/1.0.0/button.prod.min.js></script><ul><li><sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#1>1</a></sup>: In this post I call specific the ray casting algorithm used in games like Wolfenstein 3D "ray casting" for the sake of brevity. This is slightly inaccurate as ray casting has a more general meaning in the field of graphics. See the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting>Wikipedia Article</a>.<li><sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#2>2</a></sup>: To say "extending the ray" is a bit of a misnomer. "vector" is more accurate in this situation but "ray" sounds better and is in the name "ray casting" so I use it in its place.<li><sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#3>3</a></sup>: Thanks to <a href=https://github.com/Cyborus04>Cyborus04</a> for helping me with this <code>sinf</code> function.</ul></div></section><footer class="w-full p-2 flex justify-center border-t border-dotted"><p class="italic text-sm">Â© 2023 Grant Handy</footer></div>
